#Network Security Scripts 
01) checknet 

People, keep your seatbelts on and don't become overly excited as these are just simple scripts to start out with. If or when you are using a VPN or virtualized host and want to confirm your network is secure, these scripts will serve as quick fixes for that purpose. My first script checknet simply outputs the connection status via the ping command. This will run on Bash and Z-shell and should execute flawlessly in any POSIX environment. 

Hang tight for future edits I will be adding some features that check for DNS leaks and VPN connectivity - keeping everyone safe from prying eyes. 

Everything here is a work in progress. Be patient as there will be more to come. I make promises and I will deliver! 

NOTE: If you are new to bash, yes, you should append the script with the proper extension of .sh if or when you want strict adherence; hence, you can rename it as checknet.sh. However, it will run just fine as it is and I feel no need to be overly formal here. My scripts will for the most part not use extensions - though plans are subject to change in the future. If you like what you see, feel free to comment.
