Network Security Scripts 

People, keep your seatbelts on and don't become overly excited as these are just simple scripts to start out with. If or when you are using a VPN or virtualized host and want to confirm simple IP security, these scripts will serve as quick fixes for that purpose. My first script checknet simply outputs the connection status via the ping command. This will run on Bash but if you want to use it on Z-shell or another language, you'll have to modify it slightly. I'm still working on this folks. Hang tight as there's more to come! 

I will try to make these more formal with appended language extensions but for now, all of what you see is sa work in progress. Be patient as there will be more to come. I make promises and I will deliver!
